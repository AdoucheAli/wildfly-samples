= WildFly for modern application development

== Introduction to WildFly
. Explain the difference with JBoss EAP
. Download, install, and start
.. Standalone mode
.. Domain mode

== Development
. IDE: IntelliJ, JBoss Developer Studio/Eclipse, NetBeans
. Forge

== Deployment
. jboss-cli
. Admin Console
. File system-based
. Maven plugin
. REST API

== Testing

Arquillian brings the test to runtime so that you don't have to manage the runtime from the test (or build). It covers all aspects of test execution:

. Manage the lifecycle of the container (or containers)
. Bundling the test case, dependent classes and resources into a ShrinkWrap archive (or archives)
. Deploy the archive (or archives) to the container (or containers)
. Enriching the test case by providing dependency injection and other declarative services
. Executing the tests inside (or against) the container
. Capturing the results and returning them to the test runner for reporting

Three guiding principles:

. Tests should be portable to any supported container
. Tests should be executable from both the IDE and the build tool
. The platform should extend or integrate existing test frameworks

=== Remote container

=== Managed container
Managed Container is simpley a remote container that also includes lifecycle management (start and stop). Container process is started in a different JVM. Once the container is up and running, it just behaves like a remote container.
